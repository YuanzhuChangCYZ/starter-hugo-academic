Renewable generators have different fault current signatures compared to conventional synchronous generators. Hence, protective relays, set under the assumption of a conventional power system with synchronous generators, cloud malfunction under operating conditions with a high share of generation power from renewables. It is therefore necessary to investigate the performance of protection system to ensure its efficiency in the presence of renewables.<br>

The NSERC/Hydro-Québec/RTE/EDF/OPAL-RT Industrial Research Chair in Multi-Time-Frame Simulation of Transients for Large-Scale Power Systems is developing digital simulation methods for analyzing electrical signals that affect the operation of infrastructures for power transmission from generating stations to end users.<br>

Transients are short-duration disturbances of electrical waves caused by natural phenomena (e.g., lightning, falling trees, geomagnetic storms) or technical events (e.g., switching of lines, short circuits, load fluctuations). They can result in equipment failure, load shedding, and even widespread outages.<br>

The chair program will contribute to the understanding and mitigation of transients as well as optimized integration of renewable energy sources.
