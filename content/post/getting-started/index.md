## Overview

Thank you very much for the recognition of the Editor-in-Chief Prof. Alberto Tessarolo and the Editorial Board of the IEEE Transactions on Energy Conversion. 
I was also be awarded as one of the star reviewers of IEEE Transactions on Energy Conversion for 2017-2018.
I started to work as a reviewer with IEEE Transactions on Energy Conversion since September 2016. The pleasant reviewing experiences teach me a lot about how to be a reviewer as well as be an authour.
